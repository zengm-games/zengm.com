Since ${gameName} runs inside your web browser, you can edit pretty much any part of the game from within your web browser. You do this by using the JavaScript console in your browser to access the core of the game. There, you will find an API that you can use to run little scripts that edit your league.

This page explains how to access the console and shows examples of what you can do there.

## How do I access the worker console?

You can easily access a simple version of the worker console at <span class="text-highlight">Tools > Danger Zone > Worker Console</span> within any league. However, if you're doing a lot there, you may find it preferable to use your browser's built-in console. It's a little harder to access, but has a lot more functionality. How to access it depends on your browser:

**Chrome:**

1. Open your league in ${gameAcronym}.
2. Open a new tab, copy chrome://inspect/#workers into the address bar and hit enter.
3. Click "Inspect" under the URL similar to ${websitePlay}gen/worker-2020.08.02.0001.js and it will pop up another window where you can run the code snippets below.

**Firefox:**

1. Open your league in ${gameAcronym}.
2. Open a new tab, copy about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox into the address bar and hit enter.
3. Scroll down (maybe way down) until you see the "Shared Workers" section. There should be an entry there similar to /gen/worker-2020.08.02.0001.js.
4. Click "Inspect" next to it. That will open a new tab where you can run the code snippets below.

**Only needed for Safari 14 or later, and very old versions of other browsers!** If your code uses the keyword \`await\` (which is almost always true), you need to wrap it in an async function. That means you need to put \`(async () => {\` at the beginning of the code and \`})();\` at the end.

### Buff/nerf player ratings

\`\`\`
var players = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.getAll();
for (const p of players) {
    const ratings = p.ratings.at(-1);

    // Increase speed by 20%
    ratings.spd = bbgm.player.limitRating(ratings.spd * 1.2);

    // Decrease height by 10
    ratings.hgt = bbgm.player.limitRating(ratings.hgt - 10);

    // Recompute ovr and pot
    await bbgm.player.develop(p, 0);

    // Recompute player value
    await bbgm.player.updateValues(p);

    await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
}
\`\`\`

That will increase the speed rating by 20% and decrease the height rating by 10, while bounding them to the normal 0-100 range.

You can do other stuff to player ratings. These are the names of all the rating variables:

\`\`\`
${ratingKeys.join("\n")}
\`\`\`

The above code runs on all active players and draft prospects. If instead you want to run on some subset of players, you can. Generally, this code looks like:

\`\`\`
var players = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.getAll();
for (const p of players) {
    if (SOME_CONDITION) {
        const ratings = p.ratings.at(-1);
        ratings.spd = bbgm.player.limitRating(ratings.spd * 1.2);
        ratings.hgt = bbgm.player.limitRating(ratings.hgt - 10);
        await bbgm.player.develop(p, 0);
        await bbgm.player.updateValues(p);
        await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
    }
}
\`\`\`

That's saying if \`SOME_CONDITION\` is true, only then run the code to update the ratings. But what is \`SOME_CONDITION\`? Some examples:

- All draft prospects: \`if (p.tid === bbgm.PLAYER.UNDRAFTED) {\`
- All free agents: \`if (p.tid === bbgm.PLAYER.FREE_AGENT) {\`
- All players on one specific team: \`if (p.tid === 5) {\` (5 is the team ID number)
- All players at one position: \`if (p.ratings.at(-1).pos === "${bySport(
			{
				baseball: "LF",
				basketball: "PG",
				football: "WR",
				hockey: "C",
			},
			sport,
		)}") {\`
- Only a specific subset of player ID numbers: \`if ([158, 207, 14].includes(p.pid)) {\`

You can combine these conditions too, like this is all draft prospects at one position: \`if (p.tid === bbgm.PLAYER.UNDRAFTED && p.ratings.at(-1).pos === "${bySport(
			{
				baseball: "LF",
				basketball: "PG",
				football: "WR",
				hockey: "C",
			},
			sport,
		)}") {\`

Conditions like this can similarly be used for many of the code snippets below too.

### "Lock ratings" for all active players

\`\`\`
var players = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.getAll();
for (const p of players) {
    p.ratings[p.ratings.length - 1].locked = true;
    await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
}
\`\`\`

### List all the players who have died

\`\`\`
bbgm.iterate(
    bbgm.idb.league.transaction("players").store,
    undefined,
    undefined,
    player => {
        if (typeof player.diedYear === "number") {
            console.log(player.firstName + " " + player.lastName + " (" + player.born.year + " - " + player.diedYear + ")");
        }
    },
);

### Change GM History teams

[On August 20, 2020](/blog/2020/08/gm-history/), a feature was added to view your overall performance as a GM across multiple different past teams. But prior to this update, it did not track which teams you controlled in the past. If you remember, you may want to manually specify your past teams.

The numbers in the \`value\` part are team ID numbers, which you can see in URLs when you click on a team.

The numbers in the \`start\` part are the season when you took control of that team. The first one must be \`-Infinity\`, representing the team you started with in this league.

The last entry must be your current team. If you just took control of the team after controlling another team for the season and playoffs this year, then use next season for \`start\`.

\`\`\`
var history = [
    { start: -Infinity, value: 5 },
    { start: 2025, value: 7 },
    { start: 2028, value: 9 },
];

bbgm.g.userTid = history;
await bbgm.idb.cache.gameAttributes.put({
    key: "userTid",
    value: history,
});
\`\`\`

### Delete all players at a certain position

\`\`\`
var players = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.getAll();
var pids = []
for (const p of players) {
    if (p.ratings[p.ratings.length - 1].pos === "${bySport(
			{
				baseball: "LF",
				basketball: "PG",
				football: "WR",
				hockey: "C",
			},
			sport,
		)}") {
        pids.push(p.pid);
    }
}
await bbgm.player.remove(pids);
\`\`\`

### Kill a player with a custom tragic death

Replace 155 with the player ID number of the player you want to kill.

\`\`\`
async function customTragedy(pid, reason) {
    const p = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.get(pid);
    const tid = p.tid;
    await bbgm.player.retire(p, undefined, {
        logRetiredEvent: false,
    });
    p.diedYear = bbgm.g.get("season");
    await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
    bbgm.logEvent(
        {
            type: "tragedy",
            text: \`<a href="\${bbgm.helpers.leagueUrl(["player", p.pid])}">\${p.firstName} \${
                p.lastName
            }</a> \${reason}.\`,
            showNotification: true,
            pids: [p.pid],
            tids: [tid],
            persistent: true,
            score: 20,
        },
    );
}

customTragedy(155, "died with whatever text you want");

### Change the jersey number of a player

\`\`\`
var player_id_number = 150;
var new_jeresy_number = "45";

var p = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.get(player_id_number);
if (p.stats.length > 0) {
    p.stats[p.stats.length - 1].jerseyNumber = new_jeresy_number;
} else {
    p.jerseyNumber = new_jeresy_number;
}
await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
\`\`\`

### Add custom award to a player

This will show up only on the player profile page, not on any other pages in the game.

\`\`\`
var player_id_number = 150;
var p = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.get(player_id_number);
p.awards.push({
    season: 2025,
    type: "My Custom Award",
});
await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
\`\`\`

To remove that custom award:

\`\`\`
var player_id_number = 150;
var p = await bbgm.idb.cache.players.get(player_id_number);
p.awards = p.awards.filter(award => {
    if (award.season === 2025 && award.type === "My Custom Award") {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
});
await bbgm.idb.cache.players.put(p);
\`\`\`


`;
	}
};
