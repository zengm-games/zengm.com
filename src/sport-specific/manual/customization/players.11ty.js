<p>This is the simplest format to define players in a League File:</p>
<pre>
{
  "version": 66,
  "startingSeason": 2019,
  "players": [
    {
      "firstName": "Andrew",
      "lastName": "Phillips",
      "tid": 0,
      "ratings": [
        {
          ${ratings}
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "firstName": "Heriberto",
      "lastName": "Braman",
      "tid": 0,
      "ratings": [
        {
          ${ratings}
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "firstName": "Draft",
      "lastName": "Prospect",
      "tid": -2,
      "ratings": [
        {
          ${ratings}
        }
      ],
      "draft": {"year": 2020}
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
<p>Some things you might want to know:</p>
<p>tid is the team ID number, ranging from 0 to N (usually 30) for the teams in your league. Additionally,</p>
<ul>
	<li>-1 is for free agents</li>
	<li>-2 is for undrafted players</li>
	<li>-3 is for retired players</li>
</ul>
<p>
	If don't include a draft year, draft prospects will appear in the upcoming
	draft. If you want to specify multiple upcoming drafts, you need to use
	the <code>draft.year</code> property, like is done for Draft Prospect
	above. If you do this, make sure to also set
	<a href="/${sport}/manual/customization/game-attributes/"
		><code>startingSeason</code></a
	>, otherwise your draft classes will shift when the default starting
	season changes each year.
</p>
<p>
	If you specify less than ${numPlayersPerDraftClass} prospects in a draft class, random prospects
	will be created to reach that limit.
</p>

<p>
	In the example above, there are only two players defined. If your file
	doesn't include at least ${minRosterSize} players on each team, then bad things will
	happen when you try to use it. You should also include a good amount of
	bad/mediocre young players beyond the ${minRosterSize} man limit or as free agents (maybe
	30-60 in total). Otherwise, you might end up running out of free agents
	before the free agent pool naturally fills up with undrafted prospects and
	unsigned players, and then bad things will happen.
</p>
<p>
	Jersey numbers can be defined at the root of the player object like
	<code>"jerseyNumber": "25",</code>. For players with stats included, use the
	same property inside a stats object to override the jersey number for a
	specific season.
</p>
<p>
	${
		sport === "basketball"
			? "Ratings should be on a scale from 0 to 100 with a mean of about 50 and about half of the players between 35 and 65. "
			: ""
	}Descriptions of rating categories:
</p>
<ul>
	${ratingDescriptionsText}
</ul>
<p>
	It's best not to specify additional properties in the ratings object, like
	<code>ovr</code>, <code>pot</code>, <code>pos</code>, and
	<code>skills</code>. If you simply leave them out, then they will be
	auto-generated on import.
</p>
<p>
	You can optionally include a URL for an image to be used instead of a
	randomly-generated face by putting "imgURL":
	"http://www.example.com/img.jpg" in the root of a player object. <a href="/${sport}/manual/customization/player-photos-team-logos/">More information.</a>
</p>
<p>
	There are several other pieces of information you can include, such as stats from previous seasons. Look in an exported League File from
	one of your leagues to see what else can be added.
