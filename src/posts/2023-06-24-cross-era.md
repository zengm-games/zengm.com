This is not actually a new feature, just an easier UI for an existing feature! The original feature is from [last year](/blog/2022/09/create-leagues-mix/), but you need to hunt through like 5 different menus to find it. Now you can just [go here](https://play.basketball-gm.com/new_league/cross_era) and instantly create a league:

In these leagues, Random Debuts is enabled by default, which means any real players not on the initial teams will be randomized into future draft classes. If you want to disable this and have future draft classes full of randomly generated players, you can by clicking "Customize Settings" and changing the "Randomization" option.
