Every year I post some usage stats here. This year, there is some (very minor) bad news. For the first time since they were released in 2013, my games declined in popularity since last year! But it was a small decline, and 2024 was still the 2nd best year ever, so that's not really a bad year.

Is ZenGM plateauing around its current usage? Or entering a period of decline? Or just experiencing a minor road bump on the way to world domination? Check back next year to see!

On the plus side, I did change the data displayed in these blog posts a bit. Previously one of the metrics I showed was Pageviews, which is something that matters to advertisers, but is kind of meaningless otherwise. I replaced Pageviews with Seasons Simulated, which is a more interesting number.
