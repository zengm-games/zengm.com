ZenGM now has a schedule editor! I resisted adding this for a long time because it's pretty cumbersome to edit a schedule. In a default BBGM league, there are 1230 games each season, good luck manually specifying them!

But there are other situations where it might make some more sense:

- You just want to make a small tweak to the schedule
- In FBGM there are many fewer games
- In custom leagues you might have a small number of teams or games

Ultimately, it should be up to you what you want to do with the schedule. And now it is. Here's what it looks like:

If that looks interesting to you, go give it a try, or watch this video for more details:
