New UI feature! Apply bulk actions to multiple players selected on any table in the game. You can use it to:

- Compare players
- Export players
- Add players to the watch list
- (Roster page only) Release players
- (Roster page only) Start trades with players
- (God mode only) Delete players
- (God mode only) Heal injuries

Access this feature by clicking the ... feature to the top right of a table, and then click "Bulk select":

Then a column of checkboxes appears on the left side of the table, and the action buttons are right above them:
