Every year I post some usage stats here. [Last year](/blog/2025/01/2024-usage-stats/) was a bit of an anomaly - for the first time ever, usage declined! Fortunately, that trend reversed itself this year and we are back to growth, setting new records in all of the usage metrics shown below. This is due in part to the [mysterious bump in traffic on February 2, 2024](https://x.com/basketball_gm/status/1888434662877385169) which wound up persisting throughout the entire year.

Some highlights from the full data below:

- Users spent 482 years playing ZenGM games in 2025, meaning that there were an average of 482 people playing one of my games throughout the entire year, 24/7/365
- 7 million leagues were created and 25 million seasons were simulated
- Overall usage was up 13% over last year and ZenGM Baseball grew the fastest at 26%, although in absolute numbers it's still much less popular than Basketball GM and Football GM

In other news, my 2nd son is also 1 month old today, which is why there haven't been many updates lately, just some small bug fixes. Hopefully soon I will get back to adding new features!
