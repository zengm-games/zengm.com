Every year I post some usage stats here. [Last year](/blog/2025/01/2024-usage-stats/) was a bit of an anomaly - for the first time ever, usage declined! Fortunately, that trend reversed itself this year and we are back to growth, setting new records in all of the usage metrics shown below. This is due in part to the [mysterious bump in traffic on February 2, 2024](https://x.com/basketball_gm/status/1888434662877385169) which wound up persisting throughout the entire year.

In other news, my 2nd son is also 1 month old today, which is why there haven't been many updates lately, just some small bug fixes. Hopefully soon I will get back to adding new features!
