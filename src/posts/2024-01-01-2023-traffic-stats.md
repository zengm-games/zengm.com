Every year I post some traffic stats here. It's a fun tradition because the numbers keep going up. I'm sure that won't last forever, but it did for 2023. For the 11th consecutive year, my games have grown in popularity!

Total play time was 453 years. That means that every day, more than a year's worth of time was spent playing my games. Or another way to look at it is that, for the entire year, every second of every day, an average of 453 people were playing a ZenGM game.

[Basketball GM](/basketball/) is still by far my most popular game and grew the largest in absolute terms (number of users or amount of time played), but the small ones [ZenGM Baseball](/baseball/) and [ZenGM Hockey](/hockey/) grew at the fastest rate. Overall, play time increased by 15% over last year.

I am very grateful for the love and support you guys constantly show me. Thank you for helping ZenGM have yet another successful year!

2023 traffic stats:

{% trafficCharts 2023 %}

{% trafficTable 2023 %}

Some limitations of this data - it comes from Google Analytics, and Google forced everyone to upgrade to the shitty new version in the middle of 2023, and the new version tracks some of these things differently. And some people use ad blockers that block Google Analytics, in which case they won't be counted here, but that's probably a relatively small fraction of users.
