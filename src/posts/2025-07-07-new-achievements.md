I recently realized that there are 4 people who have all the achievements in Basketball GM on insane difficulty. That means I need to add a few more! Although they might make quick work of these, I'm probably fighting a losing battle...

These ones are available in all sports:

- One Draft Class: Win a title when your entire roster comes from the same draft class.

- Run It Back: Win **2** championships in a row without adding any new players to your playoff roster after the first championship.

- Run It Back 2: Win **3** championships in a row without adding any new players to your playoff roster after the first championship.

- Run It Back 3: Win **5** championships in a row without adding any new players to your playoff roster after the first championship.

And these are only in Basketball GM:

- Small Ball: Win a championship without any players over 6'5".

- The 2025 rebuild achievement requires you to win a championship in the first 3 seasons after starting a real players league in 2025 with... Charlotte! Good luck!

Also, I am aware that some of you would have won these achievements in past leagues if the achievements existed at the time. <b>Your past leagues/seasons will not be scanned for these new achievements.</b> You have to win them in a new league.
