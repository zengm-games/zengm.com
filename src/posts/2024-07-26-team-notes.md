Team Notes is a small new feature. You can see it on the roster page for each team:

When you click "Add team note", you get a small text box where you can enter any text you want about that team/season.

<!--more-->

Then that text will be displayed on the roster page for that team/season forever. This is useful if you want to make a little note to remember some special team in your league.

It's very similar to the existing Player Note feature, where you can write some small bit of text about a player on their profile page.

It also shows up in a couple other places. First, on the Team History or GM History page, any team with a note will have that note displayed on the list of seasons. It'll truncate the text to just one line, but you can click to expand it.

There is also a dedicated Team Notes page that shows all of them in one table. Access it from the little link at the bottom right of the edit box when editing a Team Note, or from a link at the top of the League History page, or (my favorite way) from the ctrl+k menu.

(Also, for those who weren't aware, a similar feature exists for player notes if you go to the Watch List, at the top you can switch it from Flagged Players to Players With Notes.)

That's it! Pretty simple feature I know, but I figured a blog post would still be nice just to fully explain things.
