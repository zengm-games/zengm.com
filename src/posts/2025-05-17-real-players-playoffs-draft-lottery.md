In real life, the draft lottery happens in the middle of the playoffs.

In BBGM, the draft lottery happens after the playoffs.

This poses a little bit of a problem when real players leagues are started in BBGM after the draft lottery has happened, but before the playoffs have ended. Because in real life the lottery is over so a lot of people want those results in their BBGM leagues, but in BBGM the lottery hasn't happened yet.

In the latest update, draft lottery results are included in real players leagues started _only during this time window_ (real draft lottery has happened, but playoffs aren't over yet). So right now, a new 2025 playoffs league will include draft lottery results. But once the playoffs end and you can start at the lottery phase, then a new 2025 playoffs league will no longer include draft lottery results.

I think this is a good compromise because currently people starting in the 2025 playoffs are mostly people who want to sim from right now into the future. Those people mostly want the real draft lottery results. But as soon as the 2025 playoffs are in the past, those people move on. Then, people simming from the 2025 playoffs are mostly people who want to replay history. And for those people, starting at the 2025 playoffs means the 2025 draft lottery hasn't happened yet.

This is all kind of confusing I know, but I think it's the best solution. Please [let me know](/contact/) if you disagree!
