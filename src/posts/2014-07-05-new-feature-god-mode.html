<p>God Mode enables some features that are a little too close to cheating for me to want enabled by default. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to create new players (this feature has been around for a while, but now it is only available in God Mode)</li>
<li>The ability to edit players (available only since <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/29wfvl/new_feature_testing_easily_edit_any_player_in_the/">earlier today</a>)</li>
<li>The ability to force trades to be accepted (brand new)</li>
</ul>

<p>To enable God Mode within a league, go to Tools > God Mode. The only caveat is that if you enable God Mode in a league, you'll no longer record any achievements for that league, for the obvious reason that God Mode makes it really easy to cheat. Even if you turn off God Mode, the achievements ban will persist.</p>
<p>If you notice any bugs in God Mode or you have ideas for other things to include in God Mode, please post here, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/29xjb5/new_feature_god_mode/">on Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/basketball.general.manager">on Facebook</a>, <a href="https://x.com/basketball_gm">on Twitter</a>, or <a href="mailto:jeremy@zengm.com">email me</a>.</p>
