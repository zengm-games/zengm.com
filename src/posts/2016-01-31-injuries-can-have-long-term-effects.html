<p>Previously, injuries in Basketball GM had no lasting effects. Once a player healed, he was good as new. In the real world, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=derrick+rose">we know that's not true</a>.</p>
<p>So now, in Basketball GM, serious injuries (over 25 games) can result in decreased athleticism, depending on the severity of the injury and some luck. As an example, someone who gets a 100 game injury (probably a torn ACL) will have a 50% chance of making a complete recovery, but also a 67% chance of losing between 0 and 10 points of his speed, jumping, and endurance ratings, and also a very small chance of a much larger catastrophic decrease. Each of those losses is independent, so someone might lose 1 speed, 9 jumping, and 3 endurance. Let me know if you think these numbers are too big or too small.</p>
