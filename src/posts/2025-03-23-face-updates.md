The latest update has two nice improvements to the cartoon player faces. First, relatives now look similar rather than being completely random. Here is an example of four brothers:

<figure class="overflow-auto"><img src="/files/face-updates-1.png"></figure>

The main caveat with the relatives feature is that it doesn't work with real players leagues, since those players don't have cartoon faces. It also won't work for any players where you use an image for the player's picture rather than a cartoon.

Another update is to the UI of the face editor. Previously it was cumbersome to save changes you made in the editor. You had to manually copy/paste the code for the face back into the game. Now, you just need to click the big blue "Save changes" button in the bottom right corner:

<figure class="overflow-auto"><img src="/files/face-updates-2.png"></figure>
