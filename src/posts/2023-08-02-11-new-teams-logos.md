Thank you to everyone on [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/12j8sb5/help_me_think_of_names_for_some_new_international/) [and](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/12s8gp6/thanks_for_all_the_ideas_for_new_team_names_i/) [Discord](/discord/) for suggesting names for new teams in some international cities. I got the usual logo designer ([Elliott Strauss](https://www.estraussdesign.com/)) to make the logos, and he just finished this week.

There was also some good timing. Right about when these logos were getting finished, a user (utmothgirl on Discord) sent me a fun logo for a team from Kentucky. That is included in this update too.

And as the title mentions, there was also a relocation in this update. Right after I released the last batch of logos, some Australian users informed me that the Melbourne Convicts was a bad name because Melbourne was actually settled by free people, not convicts. So in this batch, I moved the Convicts to Sydney (which was actually settled by convicts) and added a new team in Melbourne.

Here are all the new teams:

        <p>The name 10s is a triple entendre: (1) Argentine war of independence started in 1810; (2) the two most famous Argentinian athletes both wore #10; (3) you could say it's like a "10 out of 10", for example in a slam dunk contest. The arches in the secondary logo are inspired by the Mercado de Abasto.</p>
