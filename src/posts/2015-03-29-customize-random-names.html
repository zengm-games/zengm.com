<p>By default, Basketball GM uses random American names taken from the US Census. However if you&rsquo;re making a custom league file designed to represent a basketball league in another country, it is annoying when the new players generated in your league all have names like "John Smith".</p>
<p>Now, when creating a League File, you have the ability to define the list of names used for randomly generated players. For more info, <a href="/basketball/manual/customization/game-attributes/#player-names">check out the documentation</a>.</p>
