When creating a new Random Players or Custom league, there is a little "Customize" button next to the team selector that brings you to the Customize Teams page. There you can pick how many conferences/divisions/teams you want, and what exactly those teams are. Including both fictional teams filled with random players and real historical teams.

There is also a "Randomize..." button at the bottom that can generate a bunch of stuff for you. That's not new, but it did just get a few new features which I will explain here.

Here's what the "Randomize teams" dialog looks like now:

Some of that may look familiar. The first option to switch between generating random teams or real historical teams (only in BBGM) is the same as before. And if you select real teams, you still get to pick a range of seasons to draw from. But everything else has new features:

You can select "Keep current confs/divs" and it works similar to before - replacing all the teams with new random teams. Or you can switch to the new "Generate new confs/divs" option and it will resize your league as you desire:

This is nice because if you wanted to make big changes to league size, you had to click a few times for every team. Now if you want 60 teams or 90 teams or whatever, it's very fast to do.

Then under "Select by population" you have the old options for how to randomize teams (either completely random, or weighted by population so that larger regions get picked more). But you also have two new ones to let you pick either the smallest or largest regions only, which I think will create some fun leagues.

(Arguably those settings are out of place here because this is about "randomizing" teams, and selecting all the largest or smallest is not random. But there will still be some randomness with how they are assigned to divisions so I think it's okay!)

Finally there is a new "Continents" option to let you pick which continents to draw teams from.

Previously the only options were to pick teams from North America or the whole world, but there are now enough teams on different continents that some people want to get more specific than that.

I also moved the "Randomize..." button out of the "Reset" menu so it is always visible, because probably some people never even noticed that this feature existed. But you should notice it, because it's a cool feature!
