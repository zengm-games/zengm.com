Today I released a new feature: difficulty levels! You can pick whether you want the difficulty of your league to be easy, normal, hard, or insane. You can do this when starting a new league, or you can change it at any time by going to Tools > Options.

For a long time, I resisted adding this feature because I figured population size would be enough. Indeed, it is already true that big cities are easy while small cities are hard. It's easier to make a profit in big markets, and free agents are more eager to play in big cities.

But ultimately, I don't think that was enough. Some people still found the game too easy. Hopefully the new difficulty settings will help with that.

Like many things in BBGM, I took my inspiration from [Baseball Mogul](http://thegamedesigner.blogspot.com/2017/03/baseball-mogul-cheats.html). Below is a table explaining exactly what the difficulty settings do, although this may change in the future.

<div class="table-responsive">
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Difficulty</th>
      <th>AI willingness to trade</th>
      <th>Revenue</th>
      <th>Player mood</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Easy</th>
      <td>+2.5%</td>
      <td>+5%</td>
      <td>Small bonus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Normal</th>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Hard</th>
      <td>-2.5%</td>
      <td>-5%</td>
      <td>Small penalty</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Insane</th>
      <td>-10%</td>
      <td>-20%</td>
      <td>Large penalty</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

And if that's not good enough for you, you can tune the difficulty level to intermediate or more extreme values on the league settings page.
