Recently someone posted on Reddit about how [he completed all the achievements in Basketball GM](https://reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1bgxksp/auto_played_almost_9000_seasons_to_get_longevity/). In response to that, here are some new achievements!

<!--more-->

These ones are available in all sports:

- Revenge: Win in the finals against a team you used to control

- Around the World: Win a championship with **2** franchises in a single league

- Around the World 2: Win a championship with **10** franchises in a single league

- Around the World 3: Win a championship with **30** franchises in a single league

- Expansion to Champion 3: Win a title as an expansion team in its first season

And these are only in Basketball GM:

- Brick Wall 2: Have 5 players on the All-Defensive First Team.

- The 2024 rebuild achievement requires you to win a championship in the first 3 seasons after starting a real players league in 2024 with... Portland! Good luck!

I also added some more info to be displayed when you're picking a new team:

Some of that is intended to make the Around the World achievements a little more manageable, but mostly I think it's just useful to know this stuff.

Also, I am aware that some of you would have won these achievements in past leagues if the achievements existed at the time. <b>Your past leagues/seasons will not be scanned for these new achievements.</b> You have to win them in a new league. I will make an exception for Around the World 3, because that one is really difficult and I know a few people have posted on Reddit/Discord about doing that before. If you are sure you've earned Around the World 3, [message me and include your username](/contact/) and I will grant you the Around the World achievements on the honor policy. Please be honest!
