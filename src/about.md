Hi. My name is Jeremy aka [dumbmatter](https://dumbmatter.com/). Two of my favorite things are basketball and programming, so I created Basketball GM. That sounds simple, but it took a long time to get to where we are today!

When I was a kid, I got hooked on a game called [Baseball Mogul](https://www.sportsmogul.com/). I had always enjoyed the "GM mode" of sports games like Madden, but Baseball Mogul was different. It was a pure sports management sim, nothing more. And it was so much better than any "GM mode" I had played before.

For a long time, I had this idea in the back of my head... what if I could make something like Baseball Mogul for my favorite sport, basketball? As a kid, that was an intimidating idea. I didn't really know where to start, and I didn't think I was a good enough programmer to do it. (If you feel the same way today, [read this blog post](/blog/2019/07/so-you-want-to-write-a-sports-sim-game/).)

Finally I decided to give it a shot. In 2008, right after I finished college and before I started grad school. I thought most likely nothing would come of it - either I would fail to actually complete a game, or it wouldn't be a very good game, or nobody would care about it. Turns out I was wrong about all of those things.

I could go on and on about everything that happened between 2008 and today. And I've done that [before](/blog/2013/12/development-history)... but wow, even that blog post is really old! So here, let me give you a quick timeline of what all happened:

<b class="text-highlight">2008:</b> Basketball GM version 0.1 was released. [You can give it a try if you want.](https://basketball-gm.com/old/)

<b class="text-highlight">2012:</b> I started working on a new version of Basketball GM that would run in a web browser.

<b class="text-highlight">2013:</b> The new web version was released. [This is what it looked like back in 2013.](https://old.basketball-gm.com/)

<b class="text-highlight">2013:</b> Up until this point, I had basically no users. That started to change with [this post on /r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/), and it's been steady growth since then.

<b class="text-highlight">2017:</b> My greatest technical achievement while working on Basketball GM was [Project Iverson](/blog/tag/project-iverson/), which required rewriting a lot of code but resulted in a 10x improvement in game simulation performance.

<b class="text-highlight">2019:</b> [Football GM](/blog/2019/04/welcome/) was released, built from the same codebase as Basketball GM.

<b class="text-highlight">2020:</b> I added built-in support for [real rosters in Basketball GM](/blog/2020/04/real-players/), including [historical rosters back to 1947](/blog/2020/06/real-rosters-back-to-1947-contraction/).

<b class="text-highlight">2020:</b> Basketball GM got its first user from North Korea, meaning it has now been played in [189 of 193 countries in the world](/blog/2019/10/world-domination/).

<b class="text-highlight">2021:</b> [I quit my day job to work on my games full time.](/blog/2021/01/full-time-job/)

<b class="text-highlight">2021:</b> [ZenGM Hockey was released](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZenGMHockey/comments/lw79il/oh_shit_new_zengm_hockey_out_now_the_past_6_years/), built from the same codebase as Basketball GM and Football GM.

<b class="text-highlight">2022:</b> [ZenGM Baseball was released](/blog/2022/06/zengm-baseball/), built from the same codebase as my other games.

All throughout that time, my games have been improving and [my userbase has been growing](/blog/tag/milestone/). And it's still really fun for me to work on. There's no such thing as a sports simulation game being "done", there's always something to do.

At this point, I think my games have a pretty clear niche:

<ul>
{% include "principles.njk" %}
</ul>

[There's plenty of other great sports sim games out there filling different niches](https://gmgames.org/), many of which are superior to my games in various ways. But I don't think any of them quite check all the same boxes as my games.

What's next? Who knows. Since I'm my own boss now, in theory I should know what's next, but I'm really bad at planning. I can only promise that ZenGM will continue to grow and improve!
