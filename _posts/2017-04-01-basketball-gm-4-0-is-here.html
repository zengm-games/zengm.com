  content: Love this game! To improve it I think the cpu of other teams should be
    able to make trades. You're the only team that makes trades, so it would be a
    lot more fun if the cpu can trade by itself.

    but that's not a concern now.

  content: "I agree with the other teams could make trades by themselves to make the
    game more challenging, I'm playing with a no trade rule for myself give other
    teams championships.\r\n\r\nOther than that, ver 4.0 is awesomely fast, been playing
    this game for hundreds of seasons now before the update and a season takes a long
    time, but this version is so awesome, thanks dev"

  content: I love the changes, but I feel like when simulating, it now goes too fast,
    making it impossible to make trades within the season. When you click to stop
    while simulating the whole season, it goes to quickly. Same for the playoffs.
    Sometimes I'd like to stop just to sim one game at a time at one point, but it
    just goes too fast and does not allow for me to stop where I want to.

    You're right, it might be too fast now. I'll think about adding an option to slow it down. In the mean time, here's two things you can try:

    - Open the league in multiple tabs. That'll slow it down. The more tabs you open, the slower it'll be.

    - Don't do "Play until playoffs" or "Play through playoffs". Instead, press alt+P to simulate one day at a time, at your own pace.

  content: What about adding a cash feature in trading. Could be valuable in trades
    for prospects, draft picks etc. IK the AI would probably be difficult but it would
    be really cool.

  content: Could we get an all star game? Another thing I was thinking about that
    I can't really express is like a system in the game , which tells you who the
    current GOAT is and rankings, Also records and all time scoring , reb etc.

  content: this is about the new trade changes. I love that there are AI trades now,
    but the problem is many of them are unrealistic. I am using the NBA 2016-17 roster
    by Alexnoob. Paul George was traded for a 76ers 2017 pick which is unrealistic
    because in real life Paul George would make the 76ers better, thus making the
    pick invaluable, making me wonder if there should be a fix.

<p>This is not an April Fool's Day joke! Basketball GM 4.0 is really here, and it's awesome. For those who haven't been following along, here are the biggest changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game runs ridiculously faster than it used to.</li>
<li>It's so fast that it's actually playable on phones and tablets (iPhone/iPad support is pretty flaky still, but should improve in the near future).</li>
<li>You can <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Afr3i4X.png">easily apply complex filters to tables</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll make another post with more technical details soon, for those who are interested in such things.</p>
