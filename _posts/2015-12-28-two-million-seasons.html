    played that league abandoned it.

<p>Just 9 months ago, <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2015/03/one-million-seasons/">Basketball GM crossed the one million seasons played threshold</a>. Today the two millionth season of Basketball GM was played!</p>
<p>Here are some interesting statistics at this milestone:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Total time played:</b> 66,427,704 minutes, which equals 1,107,128 hours or 46,130 days or <b>126 years!!</b></li>
<li><b>Highest season played to:</b> 3690 - yes, that is 1675 seasons in the same league</li>
<li><b>Average number of seasons per league:</b> 2.83 - this number is so low because a lot of leagues are abandoned before a whole season is played</li>
</ul>
<p>So it took 2 years for the first million, 9 months for the second million... how long for the next million?</p>
