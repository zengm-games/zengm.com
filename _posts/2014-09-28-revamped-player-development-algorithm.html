  content: Great update. Main thing I noticed playing the beta was that players would
    not have enough endurance. It seemed really hard to get a player that could play
    more than 35 mins in a game.  I think the average starter or good player should
    be able to go at least 36 mins while they are younger, with many capable of 39-40.

  content: You honestly have to fix the height of players. You've got the development
    down. It's working great and its more realistic. BUT, having a 6'5 C going 1st
    pick isn't really THAT realistic. You must adjust heights of incoming rookies
    and overall just most of the players. If there's any way you can fix this, this
    game would be almost perfect.

  content: Height is on my list of things to fix. I think I keep ignoring it because
    it's just a number, it doesn't *really* affect gameplay. But it does make it just
    feel wrong. Thanks for the feedback!

  content: player development seems much improved. A welcome addition would be a period
    to re-sign free agents during the year, or a least a method of knowing what they're
    expecting for a contract so I don't get blindsided at the end of the season

  content: Really happy you made some changes. This game is awesome, I play it quite
    often. Haven't looked at the changes yet but Im sure they will add value to the
    game. One thing to improve upon in the future would be in game trades for people
    with large contracts. I ve noticed that rarely any time is willing to give you
    a fair trade if you have a player that has a max contract. Though this is realistic
    for the not so good players, it is highly unrealistic for those players that are
    MVP candidates. A team will always want a LeBron like player no matter the salary
    cap.

    I will keep your comment in mind when I work on it again.

    Is there something else I should be looking at when drafting? Had 3 top 5 picks,
    none have progressed past a 68 rating

<p>One of the most important parts of Basketball GM is the player development algorithm. The tricky part is that different players develop differently depending on their ages and abilities. Previously, this was handled poorly in Basketball GM. But as of today, a new player development algorithm is live and you will hopefully find it much more realistic.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's a quick list of the main improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, players could make ridiculously huge improvements in one season, like going from a scrub to a star, even in their rookie seasons. This is much less common now. Instead, players tend to have more gradual improvement over several years in their teens through mid 20s. You will not see 20 year old MVPs like you used to.</li>
<li>Previously, players could completely transform as they developed. A lumbering post player could turn into Dirk. This is also much less common now. Players can still improve, but they won't change so drastically.</li>
<li>Different ratings are handled differently. Some things are easier to improve than others. Think about the NBA... there are many players who develop their jump shots or refine their post games. But there are very few who make similarly large jumps in rebounding or passing.</li>
<li>Aging is more realistic. Previously, all ratings declined roughly equally. But that doesn't make sense. You don't forget how to play the game as you get older, you mostly just lose your athleticism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know how you like these changes. It's possible that more tweaking will be needed, but hopefully not too much because I had a lot of great help from beta testers.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback, post here, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2hqitc/revamped_player_development_algorithm_finally/">on Reddit</a>, or <a href="mailto:commissioner@basketball-gm.com">email me</a>.</p>
<p>My next major task is to try out some ideas that might significantly improve performance...</p>
