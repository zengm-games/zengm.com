<p>The fact that Basketball GM uses the same cities as NBA teams is kind of questionable from a legal standpoint. Therefore, I'm going to change that some time soon, but I want things to go as smoothly as possible. Here's what's going to happen:</p>
<!--more-->
<ol>
<li>Your current leagues will remain completely untouched.</li>
<li>New leagues will start with a new set of default teams, unless you use a custom roster file.</li>
<li>There will still be 30 teams, 2 conferences, and 6 divisions. Nothing will change except some cities and names.</li>
<li>I will make it easier to upload a custom team info file to overwrite all team names/cities.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am working on all of those things to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible. In the mean time, I have picked new cities. Here's what the current NBA cities look like on a map (thank you <a href="http://multiplottr.com/">Multiplottr</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/files/realignment_before.png"></p>
<p>I took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_urban_agglomerations_in_North_America">this list of the largest "urban agglomerations" in North America</a>, sorted it by size, and deleted every city outside the US/Canada except Mexico City. I also deleted Riverside-San Bernardino since that seems too close to Los Angeles. That left me with a list that mostly overlaps with the NBA, with the following exceptions.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Removed:</b> Charlotte, Indianapolis, Memphis, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Salt Lake City, San Antonio</li>
<li><b>Added:</b> Baltimore, Cincinnati, Las Vegas, Mexico City, Montreal, Pittsburgh, San Diego, Seattle, St. Louis, Vancouver, Tampa</li>
</ul>
<p>This created a new, largely similar map:</p>
<p><img src="/files/realignment_after.png"></p>
<p>Sure, it's a little more biased towards the coasts, but I was able to come up with some reasonable divisions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Atlantic:</b> Boston, Montreal, New York City, Philadelphia, Toronto</li>
<li><b>Central:</b> Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh</li>
<li><b>Southeast:</b> Atlanta, Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, Washington</li>
<li><b>Southwest:</b> Dallas, Houston, Mexico City, Phoenix, St. Louis</li>
<li><b>Northwest:</b> Denver, Minneapolis, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver</li>
<li><b>Pacific:</b> Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the old cities that remain are in the same conference they were originally except for Phoenix, which I had to move from the Pacific to the Southwest.</p>
<p>Since none of this is live yet, your feedback could still convince me to change the cities, but I'm pretty happy with them right now. What I definitely need your feedback on is team names. Each city needs a name. A good name. And, most importantly, a name that isn't too similar to the NBA team in that city. If you want to suggest the name for a city, please post here or on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1vjlcu/the_great_realignment_help_pick_new_team_names/">Reddit</a>.</p>
