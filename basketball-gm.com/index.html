        <h4>You Set The Strategy</h4>
        <p>Running a basketball team requires you to make tough decisions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Should you re-sign a veteran player, or leave cap space open to sign a free agent?</li>
          <li>Should you draft a raw player who could be a star, or someone who can contribute right away?</li>
          <li>Should you trade away next season's draft pick for a player who can help you win now, or stockpile assets for the future?</li>
          <li>Should you raise ticket prices and annoy your fans, or can you cut part of your budget instead?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Make the right choices and you can build a dynasty. But make the wrong choices and you'll get fired!</p>
