build performance
- 25 minutes
- alternatives
  - https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog/blob/main/_includes/layouts/base.njk uses addHash
    - https://github.com/mightyplow/eleventy-plugin-cache-buster looks similar
  - check expiration in htaccess
  - minify css/js
  - compress images

basketball-gm.com, football-gm.com
- check all the URLs on basketball-gm.com and football-gm.com - make sure they are redirected to zengm.com
- include .htaccess files for basketball-gm.com and football-gm.com in build
- check rss feed URLs too, they are processed differently to make them absolute already
  - use same logic in feed.xml
  - see https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-rss/blob/master/src/htmlToAbsoluteUrls.js
- TEST
- update deploy script, make sure it looks right for new domains

sidebar menu
- use eleventyNavigation?
  - could also use that to replace the hacky parent system i built...
    - show main title in <h1> everywhere, and breadcrumbs at top. except maybe blog listing?

multiple sites
- https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/662
- https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pages-from-data/
  - data could just be the names of the sports, then whatever template language i use could do if/else inline
- or, use JS templates and write bySport/isSport equivalents

redirect basketball-gm.com/files and football-gm.com/files

# later

tag blog posts with sport and show icon somehow, like changelog?

eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight
- can't be used from JS template :(
