				<p>Our games all follow some core principles:</p>

				<ul class="main-list">
					<li><span class="headline">Completely free</span><br>
						No in-game purchases, no "pay to win", no microtransactions. You don't even have to log in or make an account to play.</li>

					<li><span class="headline">Customizable</span><br>
						Our games are deeply customizable through an in-game "God Mode" or custom league files. We also make our <a href="https://github.com/dumbmatter/gm-games">source</a> <a href="https://github.com/dumbmatter/zengm-legacy">code</a> available so you can see how our games work and play around with the internals.</li>

					<li><span class="headline">Web-based</span><br>
						Play our games in any web browser on any device. Desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile - it all works. No downloads, no installation, no special permissions needed.</li>

					<li><span class="headline">Minimal micromanagement</span><br>
						Simulation games need depth, but they need the right amount of depth with a UI to help you make sense of it. We seek to avoid mandatory micromanagement as much as possible. Video games should be fun, not tedious.</li>

				<h1>About Us</h1>
				
				<p>ZenGM is currently just one person, me. My name is Jeremy aka dumbmatter. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:jeremy@zengm.com">jeremy@zengm.com</a> or <a href="/contact/">on social media</a>.</p>
				
				<p class="mb-0">I started working on <a href="https://baksetball-gm.com/">Basketball GM</a> in 2008. Originally it was a hobby project to scratch an itch and hone my programming skills. Over the years it slowly grew into what it is today, a collection of multiple web-based sports simulation games enjoyed by tens of thousands of users. It's been a crazy ride, and I think the best still lies ahead!</p>
