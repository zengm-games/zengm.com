<p>Until today, Basketball GM was hardcoded to always have 2 conferences, 6 divisions, and 16 teams in the playoffs. If you wanted to set up a league with a different structure, you were out of luck.</p>
<p>But today that has changed! You can have any number of conferences and divisions, and the number of teams in the playoffs can be any power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc). Unfortunately this is only customizable by making a league JSON file, but it's not that hard, I promise. <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/manual/customization/game-attributes/#confs-divs">Here is the documentation</a> and <a href="https://basketball-gm.com/files/three_conferences.json">here is an example file with 3 conferences, 6 divisions, 12 teams, and a 4 team playoff</a>.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you notice bugs related to this!</p>
