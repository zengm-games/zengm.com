<p>The default teams now have logos! Thank you <a href="https://www.behance.net/straussdesign">Elliott Strauss</a> for all your hard work!</p>
<p>Currently you'll only see the logos on the roster page, which doesn't really do them justice. Eventually I will do a redesign to better utilize them. In the mean time, check them out here in their full glory:</p>
