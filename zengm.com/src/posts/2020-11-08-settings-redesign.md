I just deployed an update including a completely re-designed league settings page. Try it at Tools > League Settings.

Mostly this is just a cosmetic change, but it does have one functional improvement: several of the settings that were previously available only in God Mode are now available any time. Things that don't affect your ability to succeed in the game or win achievements, such as enabling the Elam Ending. Sure it changes game simulation, but it doesn't make it any easier to accomplish anything, so no advantage can be gained by toggling that option.

The cosmetic changes are:

- The settings page is much more aesthetically pleasing now.

- Combined the old God Mode Options and League Options pages into one, because it didn't really make sense to have two different places for league settings.

- When you're not in God Mode, there is a filter to only show the settings you're allowed to change without enabling God Mode.

Here's what it looks like:
