Basketball GM and [Football GM](https://play.football-gm.com/) can be played at whatever speed you want. Some people like to fly through decades as fast as possible. Others like to micromanage each season. For people who play fast, one annoying thing is when you forget who your players are. Like you're looking at your roster and you think... is that the guy I drafted last year, or the guy I traded for, or the free agent I signed?

Now, you can easily answer this question on the roster page by looking in the new "Acquired" column, which will tell you how each player was acquired. It looks like this:

<a href="/files/acquired.png"><img src="/files/acquired.png"></a>

In new leagues, it will be blank for the first season. I could fill it in with history from before the league started, but I think it might be even more useful blank because then you can clearly see which players you personally acquired, as opposed to players who were acquired before you started playing.

I also want to make a point here about user feedback. I've always encouraged it. If you haven't sent me any yet, [please get in touch](https://basketball-gm.com/contact/). My most commont response is something like, "That's a good idea, but I'm not sure when I'll get around to it." But sometimes my response is, "That's a good idea, and I'll get right on it!"

That's what happened here. Someone emailed me earlier this week explaining the aforementioned problem of remembering where players came from, and suggesting I show it on the roster screen. Prior to that I was vaguely aware that this was a problem, but it wasn't at the front of my mind. This email made me actively think about it and proposed a good solution. A few days later and here we are! So please, if you have any suggestions, feel free to [reach out](https://basketball-gm.com/contact/). Even if I don't immediately start working on your suggestion, it helps me know what users want, which helps me prioritize my work in the future.
