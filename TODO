redirect basketball-gm.com/files and football-gm.com/files

tag blog posts with sport and show icon somehow, like changelog?

eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight
- can't be used from JS template :(

sidebar menu
- use eleventyNavigation?
  - could also use that to replace the hacky parent system i built...
    - show main title in <h1> everywhere, and breadcrumbs at top. except maybe blog listing?
    - for non-nested pages (no sport picker), should it show "ZenGM" or the name of the game in the titlebar?

paginate tag index pages
