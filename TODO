switch to sass-embedded for performance, only after i can upgrade to sass 1.78 or higher, because that's the first version which includes the CLI. probably requires another version of bootstrap to be released, since that's the limiting factor keeping it pinned now

redirect basketball-gm.com/files and football-gm.com/files

tag blog posts with sport and show icon somehow, like changelog?

eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight
- can't be used from JS template :(

sidebar menu
- use eleventyNavigation?
  - could also use that to replace the hacky parent system i built...
    - show main title in <h1> everywhere, and breadcrumbs at top. except maybe blog listing?
    - for non-nested pages (no sport picker), should it show "ZenGM" or the name of the game in the titlebar?

paginate tag index pages
